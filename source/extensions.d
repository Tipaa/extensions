/**
	Lets the variable or function be accessed or evaluated in a lazy fashion without being a lazy parameter

	By hiding the variable inside a delegate, the variable is not called because it isn't touched, but is stored 
	inside the delegate which can be accessed normally. This calling this delegate then touches the lazy value.
	The lazyV struct get() method does this, and is aliased into lazyV itself, so accessing lazyV will return
	get() which returns the delegate, accessing and returning the lazy value only at the time that lazyV is 
	accessed.

/**
	Spawns a function that runs in parallel with the main thread, and returns a value once finished

	Coroutine spawns the aliased function with the parameters it is given in its constructor, runs
	it in parallel, and then captures the result. This result is aliased to coroutine, so accessing
	the coroutine returns the result, unless the coroutine was specifically asked for.

	Coroutine creation is non-blocking, while accessing the result is blocking. Because of this, it
	is best	to start them earlier than needed to run in parallel with the main thread, and then 
	access them	only once needed, as if it were a lazy value.

	It is possible to make coroutines communicate by passing them a channel argument to the function,
	or by passing a Tid and sending messages directly.

/**
	Channel is a parallel message queue backed by a DList that allows other threads to communicate
	with each other without locks

	Upon instantiation, channel spawns a function that accepts two types of message - a put and a 
	get, or 'send' and 'receive'. With each message, it then tells the internal class instance
	what to do with the list in a manner that emulates a queue. This means that the list access is
	restricted to a single thread, and synchronisation issues are avoided by using the concurrency
	primitives in the standard library, which are backed by an event queue.

	This approach means that the interaction with the message queue is done entirely with messages,
	avoiding any locks at this level or higher.
